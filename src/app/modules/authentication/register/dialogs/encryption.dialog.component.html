<h2 mat-dialog-title>How we store your credentials</h2>
<mat-dialog-content class="mat-typography">
  <h3>Encryption</h3>
  <p>We use a protocol called SRP (Secure Remote Password Protocol). This protocol means that in short we never know
    your password, or store any information relating to your password. What we do store is a username, a salt and a verifier. When
    signing in private keys are generated by the front end and sent to the core. The front end and the back end share keys and via algorithms
    reach the same verifier, thus confirming authentication. No passwords are ever exchanged and no passwords are ever stored, this protects against
    a data breach and from man-in-the-middle attacks.
  </p>
  <p>
    A lot of other servers use basic hashing to store your password and are usually stored using a SHA1 hash, with a salt of your username. This means
    the algorithm used to mask the password is SHA1 with the key of the username. SHA1 is officially insecure, and using a salt of a known value makes
    it even more insecure. If someone gets access to the auth database of a server using this primitive encryption it is very easy to retrieve the value
    of a password.
  </p>
  <p>Further information on SRP can be found <a style="color: white" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Remote_Password_protocol">here</a></p>

  <h3>We don't store your email</h3>
  <p>We don't require your email because we don't need it. We don't have a need to send out marketing emails. We can use
    more sophisticated means of identifying who you are if you require a password reset.</p>

  <p>We also don't store your email because we understand that an email address is usually the username for the
    majority of sites that have more sensitive data; if our databases ever get exposed you can have some piece of
    mind knowing that your username for your banking, shopping, facebook, reddit won't be exposed.</p>

  <h3>Firewalls</h3>
  <p>We have strict firewall rules infront of our database servers that are managed outside of MySQL. This means traffic from only
    our website backend, and the game servers have access based on IP and Packet tagging restricting access to only certain devices
    and only certain communication technologies, drastically reducing the data exposed to the outside world.
  </p>

  <h3>We're not security experts</h3>
  <p>All of this information is here for your peace of mind. We take security seriously and in everything we do we consider security.
    We are however not security experts and do not claim to be.
  </p>

  <p>
    We would still encourage you to use throwaway credentials that are unique to only this server so that in the case we do have a breach
    and data is exposed you have peace of mind none of your sensitive information has been exposed.
